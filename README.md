## Part one
We are in  
[![CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/img/cake-logo.svg)](https://cakephp.org/)


## Installation

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer install
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start up the built-in webserver with:
```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the application. :smiley:
